================
Memory Allocator
================

A minimalistic memory allocator that can be used to manually
manage virtual memory. The goal is to have a reliable library
that accounts for explicit allocation, reallocation, and
initialization of memory.

Objectives
Learn the basics of memory management by implementing minimal versions
of malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free().
Accommodate with the memory management syscalls in Linux: brk(),
mmap(), and munmap().
Understand the bottlenecks of memory allocation and how to reduce them.

The project is not complete.
